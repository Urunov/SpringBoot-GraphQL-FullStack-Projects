# Part-5.Spring Boot and GraphQL project 

   ## Adding Maven Dependencies 
    * Create a sample Spring Boot application and add the following dependencies.
       -> graphql-spring-boot-starter is used for enabling GraphQL servlet and it becomes available at a path /graphql. It initializes GraphQLSchema bean.
       -> graphql-java allows to write schema with GraphQL schema language which is simple to understand.
    graphiql-spring-boot-starter provides user interface using which we could test our GraphQL queries and view query definition.
