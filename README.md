       * The example defines a basic JPA annontated data model containing a single entity, Person. When spring-boot runs it takes that entity definition and creates an in-memory H2 embedded [database with pre-poluated dummy data](https://github.com/Urunov/SpringBoot-GraphQL-FullStack-Projects/tree/master/Spring-Boot-Graphql-MySQL-Hibernate-JPA).
