Part-1. Project: GraphQL-JPA-MySQL
      
 *  We will create two tables Category and Product. So each product must belong to a category and a category may have multiple products under it. So Product will have many-to-one relationship with Category.
 * We are going to use Spring Data JPA to perform database activities using Springâ€™s built-in API JpaRepository that provides functions for performing basic CRUD operations out of the box.
